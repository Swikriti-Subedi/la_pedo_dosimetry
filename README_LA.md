- Code for a website that can calculate the Maximum Recommended Dose(MRD) of Local Anesthesia (LA) used in Dentistry.Its based on the patient's weight and absolute maximum.

- It is only 'one' of the ways to avoid LA overdose. Please use clinical discernment, experience, and knowledge of the subject matter.

- All the MRD of LA based on weight is in 'milligram' and 'with vasoconstrictor '

- Both MRD of LA-based on weight and absolute maximum is as per FDA guidelines and as mentioned in the textbook "Hand book of Local Anesthesia" by Stanely H Malamed, 7thedition.

- MRDs used for the calculation: (with epinephrine) MRD for Lidocaine & Articaine = 500mg of LA , Mepivacaine = 400mg, Prilocaine = 600mg, Bupivacaine = 200mg

- MRD calculated based on weight will never exceed the absolute maximum mg given for each LA mentioned above. Therefore, after a certain weight, MRD based on weight will remain the same i.e Absolute Maximum Value. This cutoff weight is not exact (due to roundoff) but is a tentative value.

- MRD based on weight for each LA:(with epinephrine) Lidocaine & Articaine = 7mg/kg Mepivacaine = 6.6mg/kg Prilocaine = 8mg/kg Bupivacine = 2mg/kg
