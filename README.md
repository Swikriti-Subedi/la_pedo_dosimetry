# Pediatric Dosimetry based on weight and adult dose

- This is code for a website to calculate the pediatric dose, both in the mg form used in tablets and mg/ml as used in syrup form.

- Adult dose entered must be in mg of drug per 'administration or dose'
For Eg: The adult dose of Amoxicillin 500mg TDS
enter adult dose as 500mg.
Patient age = 3 years.
The resultant value in mg for a patient of 3 years is 100mg. Your final prescription is 100mg TDS i.e 100mg per dose. It is the same for the calculation of doses in syrup form as well.

- Young's Formula is one of the ways to find pediatric dose from adult dose using patient's weight. Please use information on this website, along with clinical discernment, experience, and knowledge of the subject matter.
